Whether you’re designing a new hotel website or trying to give yours a refresh, a little inspiration can go a long way towards making some meaningful progress. Below, we take a look at some refreshing examples of the best hotel website design from across the globe. We also cover the key things you need to make your own hotel website stand out.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Copy and media that showcase your benefits. Show off your value proposition for guests with high-quality images and video, clear messaging, and engaging content.</li>
                <li>Strategic white space. Empty space helps guide the eyes of your reader to what’s important, while keeping the page from becoming overwhelming or cluttered.</li>
                <li>Contact information. Consider live chat, hotel chatbots, or a texting function to help those with questions get quick answers.</li>
                <li>Great technical SEO. Fast page loads, compressed images, search-engine optimized text, and site security all help your site be found by more people.</li>
                <li>Clear navigation. Make it easy for guests to find the information they need related to room booking, amenities, events, etc.</li>
                <li>Accessibility. Ensure that those with limited vision, hearing, or other accessibility needs can easily get the information they’re seeking.</li>
                <li>A streamlined checkout process. Reduce unnecessary steps in your conversion process so that visitors can quickly and easily accomplish their task.</li>
                <li>Responsive design. Your design should easily accommodate a variety of screen sizes and devices, including a fully-optimized mobile experience</li>
            </ul>

            <div className="text-start">
            <p>If you do choose to use video on your site, make sure that it's subtle and supports your goals for the viewer. If the colors in the video are distracting, consider adding a semi-transparent overlay in a brand color. This will tie the look together with the rest of the site and allow the visitor to focus on any messaging you put on top of the video.</p>
